# Splitting-Data
The train-test split procedure is used to estimate the performance of machine learning algorithms when they are used to make predictions on data not used to train the model.

It is a fast and easy procedure to perform, the results of which allow you to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for your predictive modeling problem. Although simple to use and interpret, there are times when the procedure should not be used, such as when you have a small dataset and situations where additional configuration is required, such as when it is used for classification and the dataset is not balanced.
